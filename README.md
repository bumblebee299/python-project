## Overview

This project uses a linear regression model to predict a student's test score based on the number of hours they studied. It is implemented in Python using scikit-learn and visualized with matplotlib. The notebook is suitable for educational purposes and can be extended with real-world datasets.

## Features

- **Data Preparation:** Uses a simple dataset of hours studied vs. test scores.
- **Model Training:** Implements linear regression using scikit-learn.
- **Prediction:** Predicts test scores for new input values.
- **Visualization:** Plots the regression line and actual data points.
- **Easy to Extend:** Replace the sample data with your own CSV for real-world use.

## Dataset

The sample dataset included:

| Hours_Studied | Test_Score |
|---------------|------------|
| 5             | 50         |
| 8             | 55         |
| 10            | 60         |
| 14            | 65         |
| 12            | 98         |
| 11            | 75         |
| 1             | 80         |
| 13            | 85         |
| 15            | 90         |

You can replace this with your own data by modifying the `data` dictionary or loading a CSV file.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading:** Loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Feature Selection:** Uses 'Hours_Studied' as the feature and 'Test_Score' as the target.
3. **Train-Test Split:** Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training:** Fits a linear regression model.
5. **Prediction:** Predicts test scores for test data and new input.
6. **Visualization:** Plots the regression line and data points.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-predictor.git
   cd student-performance-predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook:**
   - Open `project-student-performance-predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
   - Execute the cells to see the results and visualizations.

4. **Modify the dataset:**
   - Replace the sample data with your own data for customized predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Results

- The model prints actual vs. predicted test scores for the test set.
- Predicts the test score for a new student (e.g., 8.5 hours studied).
- Displays a scatter plot with the regression line for visual analysis.
